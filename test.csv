Imomoko.com not only ships to US, Canada, Australia, and UK, they take in your orders via email if you live in other countries. I find their customer service quite efficient as they do their best to accommodate your requests. It's also a huge plus to see so many brands housed under one site! Some of you have asked if I shop on ebay, but I'm not a huge fan of ebay shopping. I've done so a couple times, but I find that many of the products I want are often overpriced. Imomoko.com has given me most of the products I am showing here today to give everyone a taste of some of their many diverse products and brands they carry! I am not getting paid in doing this review. I thought it would be useful to those of you who have more of a difficult time finding a reliable site that ships to more countries than one!I hope you find this video useful, and thank you for watching! n♥You can use my promocode for 10% discounts on any imomoko.com order: OISEAU88n♥Products Shown:n1.

9145128,A CHEMIST'S THOUGHTS ON TATI WESTBROOK HALO BEAUTY VITAMINS,"Note: I Speak about FDA Standards here in the sense of they need to meet requirements for FDA Dietary Supplements meaning they don’t misbrand and the ingredients are safe. Which are the regulations set in place. https://www.fda.gov/Food/DietarySupplements/  If this were not the case, the FDA has the authority to address this, and that is how the FDA regulates dietary supplements, which does need improvement, but does exist. I then further go in to talk about the testing she discusses which I refer to as “standard.” By this I mean the practices she discusses are common. These are the practices that should be minimally expected for a facility manufacturing supplements, and This is why many facilities also have 3rd party audits, which have expectations much higher than the FDA guidelines for manufacturing. which is what people like Tati would want to see prior to working with them . They are not out of the ordinary. The study I refer to is for her ceramides Rx, not the whole supplement, which only has self reported results. nnThis video is only my opinion and why I would not buy these supplements, and my opinion on what should be minimally expected of places producing supplements, as well as my thoughts on how vitamins are marketed, this also extends past just her supplements. I was not confident to purchase these supplements, if you are, I would be interested in seeing your progress. nnI am sharing my thoughts on Tati Westbrook's Halo Beauty Vitamins from a Quality Control Chemist Perspective.  I discuss the safety and claims Tati's Dietary Supplements.  The Halo Beauty Supplements have cause a lot of controversy and I cover the safety of Saw Palmetto.  I discuss her claims of her facility being up to FDA Vitamin Regulation Standards.nnLink Jen luvs Reviews Shared: https://nccih.nih.gov/health/palmetto/ataglance.htm#safetynnnMore links with extra info regarding supplements:nhttps://www.allure.com/story/tati-westbrook-halo-beauty-supplement-birth-control-controversynnhttps://www.umm.edu/health/medical/altmed/herb/saw-palmettonhttps://www.fda.gov/Food/DietarySupplements/nhttps://www.consumerreports.org/dietary-supplements/truth-about-hair-skin-nail-supplements/nhttps://www.consumerreports.org/vitamins-supplements/what-usp-verified-and-other-supplement-seals-mean/nhttps://phytoceramidescenter.com/phytoceramides-information/saggy-skin-tackled-within-phytoceramides-skill/ (this is a article from a website only about ceramides, so keep that in mind)",0EgvbcH9qb4,

15394554,抗皺抗癌　不老飲品留住青春,近年被美容界奉為抗氧化養顏聖品的白藜蘆醇（resveratrol），首次被提煉為不含酒精的液態飲品，聲稱可以延緩衰老，對抗皺紋甚至有抗癌功能。nn「泉源︰美容分子」（Fountain:The Beauty Molecule）由英國著名美容品牌Boots推出，聲稱白藜蘆醇變成液體飲用後，更容易被人體吸引，可以延緩衰老，對抗皺紋，對整體健康都有幫助。飲品加入酸酸甜甜的石榴味，外形似足咳藥水，每瓶240毫升售24.99英鎊（301港元），一點也不便宜，Boots建議用家每天服用一茶匙。 nn白藜蘆醇抗氧化nn白藜蘆醇早於1939年由日本人從植物白藜蘆的根莖裏提取出來，這種神奇物質在紅葡萄果皮、紅酒、花生上都能找到，經不同學者研究後，除了發現有極佳的抗氧化功效、能延緩細胞老化過程外，還能抗發炎、保護神經系統、阻止膽固醇在血管沉積。先後有學者在昆蟲和老鼠身上做實驗，更指白藜蘆醇能延長壽命。但亦有人質疑相關實驗其實是酒商贊助，事實上未有確實證據顯示白藜蘆醇有助長壽。,8wbhuoXljaU,

3144704,Lancome Miracle Cushion Foundation Review by Chloe Morello,"In todays video I review the awesome Miracle Cushion from Lancome! Please note I got the price wrong, the Myer/DJs website is confusing it wasn't 100% clear that for $90 you get a refill with it. It retails for $60 for the compact in Aus! and between $40 & $50 in the US, £20-30 in England!nnI have been trying this out for about 5 months and it's become one of my makeup bag/handbag must-haves! I love it so much, mostly for the convenience but also the finish on the skin.nnI use colours #4 and #2 personally, sometimes I mix them to suit my skin tone at the time.nnOfficial Aussie site about it if you want to learn more http://www.lancome.com.au/whats-new/lancome-selection/new-miracle-cushion?gclid=Cj0KEQjw5MGxBRDiuZm2icXX2-sBEiQA619bq-z9NjdIxU8SQ14OQ5vRDsxLkiXLaXLARMQQsaRSb3waAusL8P8HAQnnYou guys can buy it from:nAdore Beauty (OMG ITS ONLY $60AUD!): http://bit.ly/1Wfec83nSephora: http://bit.ly/1O4FNEunDavid Jones: http://bit.ly/1kLmCDa OK SO FOR THE $90 YOU GET A REFILL WITH ITnNordstrom: http://bit.ly/1XvN5m6nn----------------------------nnManager/Business Inquiries ONLY: Jill Birmingham, MAX CONNECTORS (Jill@MaxConnectors.com.au)nn*Please note I am not currently available for makeup artist services*nnSubscribe to my Vlog Channel: http://www.youtube.com/ChloeMorelloVlogsnnPlease join me on any of my social networking and blogging sites:nnFACEBOOK: http://www.facebook.com/ChloeMorelloBeautynBLOG: http://www.chloemorello.comnTWITTER: http://twitter.com/chloemorellonINSTAGRAM: http://instagram.com/ChloeMorellonn----------------------------nnMY SIGMA BRUSHES LINK: http://bit.ly/1FCgNh3 Use the code ChloeMorello10 for 10% off!nWHERE I BULK BUY FALSE EYELASHES: http://bit.ly/1U0IBSU",3LfGT_TxKh8,

Your body regulates pH (the balance between acid and alkaline) in the same manner it regulates temperature.nnYour body is alkaline by design, but acidic by function.nnAcids that build up cause acidification of your fluids (your body is 70% water) and tissues. This can lead to a long list of health problems.nnIt's extremely important to maintain proper pH balance within your body.nnTesting your pH is the first step.nnpH Test strips are the best indicators of the pH of your body fluids. They're easier to use than pH paper or litmus paper and more accurate as well.nnYou can get pH Stix testing strips at your local health store or online from many retailers.nnOnce you know what the pH of your body is, you can determine a proper course of action if you are indeed too acidic.nnThis would include an alkaline pH diet (higher intake of alkaline foods & less acidic foods) as well as proper supplementation.nnSupplementaion would include drinking high pH alkaline water as well as more eating alkalizing greens (in food, juice, capsule form or as a green drink), alkaline minerals, and more.nnhttp://youtu.be/f8yWJHCkdJUnhttp://www.youtube.com/user/pHionBalance",f8yWJHCkdJU,

We are live from mynbathroom and I am just getting ready for work. I am going to demo a productnfor you. It is the Recipe for Men Under Eye Patches. It comes in a boxnlike, there were three sets of patches, and it is just one patch for eachnunder-eye area. It is not something you would use every day, it is more ofna treatment product if you had a really late night or rough night, you havenbeen partying, it is a good product to use that will help to refresh,nreduce puffiness, etc.nnI am going to pop it open and put it on so you can see what it is like.nJust tear it open, and then there are two patches inside. Basically, takenone patch, which is this little piece, and what they do is they use whatnthey refer to as Transdermal Cosmetic Delivery System, which is anproprietary technology. What it allows for the patch to do is deliver thenreally high-grade ingredients like marine collagen and something else whichnI am forgetting, algae extracts, deep into the surface of the skin, so itnprovides a really deep hydration and helps to restore the under-eye area.nnPut the other one here, and make sure we put it the right way, and I amngood to go. As you can see, they sit really nicely. You would leave it onnfor 20 to 30 minutes then take them off. You do not have to put on eyencream or anything else afterwards, you are pretty much done after you donthis.nnThat is it. That is the Recipe for Men Under Eye Patches. Check it out atnShopMASC.com.
